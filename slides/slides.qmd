# What is sentiment analysis?{background-color="#40666e" .center}

Sentiment Analysis is a  __subfield of Natural Language Processing __ (NLP) that involves  __determining the emotional/sentiment value of a text__ .


## What is sentiment analysis?

Sentiment analysis can be used to:

  - **understand human behaviour** in digital spaces
  - **analyse texts** from books, social media, blogs, websites, and other digital platforms
  - analyse **opinions** and cultural representations
  - study the **evolution of language** and sentiment over time

## Sentiment analysis is, in short, __the process of extracting the emotional value of a text__. {background-color="#40666e" .center}

not to be confused with the emotions the reader <span style="color:yellow;">may feel</span> when reading a text

##

In its most simple form, it accounts for either  __positive__  or  __negative__  sentiment. However, more complex models can account for a wider range of  __emotions__ , such as joy, anger, sadness, and fear.

# So, How Does Sentiment Analysis Work? {background-color="#40666e"}

## Lexicon-based SA

Lexicon-based approaches use predefined word lists (lexicons) with assigned sentiment scores.

Example:

  - “This book is fantastic ! It tells wonderful and beautiful things…”
  - “In those days, sadness shadowed my heart”


## Lexicon-based SA

Lexicon-based approaches use predefined word lists (lexicons) with assigned sentiment scores.

Example:

  - “This book is <span style="color:#ff0000">fantastic</span> ! It tells <span style="color:#ff0000">wonderful</span> and <span style="color:#ff0000">beautiful</span> things…”
  - “In those days, <span style="color:#0070c0">sadness</span>  <span style="color:#0070c0">shadowed</span> my heart”


### Strengths and limitations

- Strengths: Simple, interpretable, no training required.
- Limitations: Struggles with negation, sarcasm, and context.

## Other SA methods
- **Rule-based SA**: Uses hand-crafted rules to identify sentiment.
- **Machine Learning-based SA**: Uses labeled datasets to train models for sentiment classification.
- **Deep Learning-based SA**: Uses neural networks (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) to model sentiment.
- **Aspect-based SA**: Extracts sentiment related to specific aspects of a text.


## Multiple SA Applications

- **SA for the study of historical texts**: Sprugnoli et al., _Towards sentiment analysis for historical texts_ [-@Sprugnoli2016].
- **SA and cognitive studies**: Jacobs et al., _What’s in the brain that ink may character_ [-@Jacobs2017].
- **SA for political discourse**: Thakur, _Sentiment analysis of the public discourse on Twitter about COVID-19_ [-@Thakur2023].
- **SA in literary studies**: Reagan et al., _The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes_ [-@Reagan2016].


## SA Critical Aspects {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Subjectivity**: SA may struggle with nuanced or ambiguous language

**Ambiguity and Polysemy**: Words with multiple meanings can lead to misinterpretations.

**Irony and Sarcasm**: Algorithms may fail to detect sarcasm or irony.

**Context Sensitivity**: Sentiment analysis can fail to account for broader context.

**Data Bias**: Models trained on biased data may not generalize well.

**Domain Specificity**: Models trained on general datasets may need to be fine-tuned for domain-specific accuracy.

**Temporal Dynamics**: Sentiment can evolve over time, and static models may miss these changes.
